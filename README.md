> The minty fresh way to launch an NFT project. :leaves:

Fresh is an all-in-one tool to deploy an NFT project on the Flow blockchain using Next.js and IPFS.

Here's what `fresh` gives you:

- A custom read-to-deploy NFT contract.
- A simple command to mint NFT sets from CSV and image data.
- A pre-built app template for running a live NFT drop.

## Quick start

Generate a new project that is preconfigured to use freshmint:

```sh
npx @onflow/fresh start
```

## Installation

You can also install freshmint using NPM:

```sh
npm install -g @onflow/fresh

# start a new project
fresh start
```

## Acknowledgments

Fresh owes its existence to [minty](https://github.com/yusefnapora/minty),
an NFT minting tool for IPFS developed by @yusefnapora. 
Much of the core logic in fresh is borrowed from minty.
